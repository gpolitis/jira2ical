A super-tiny utility that converts Jira issues into an iCalendar file to make
it possible to include in Thunderbird. Note that you need to copy/paste the
cookies from Chrome to make this work. You would run it like this :

    ./jira2ics.py --chrome-cookies chrome_cookie.txt https://jira.example.com
